1. Photo Gallery
You're designing a mobile photo gallery interface. A designer on the team delivers mockups for a grid view and detailed photo view and asks you to help define the transition between the two states. If you have additional time, you can consider secondary actions, such as items in the detail view toolbar.
Things to think about:

How might you build a smooth transition from the grid view to the detail view?
How could you use gestures to enhance the interactivity? e.g. should users swipe to move between images?
Feel free to use any technologies, libraries, or frameworks you like to build the gallery.
The gallery should be viewable on a mobile device, and any code you produce should be clean and extensible.
